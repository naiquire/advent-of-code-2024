# Advent of Code 2024
This is a collection of some of my favourite solutions that i made to some of the problems from AOC 2024
- some problems only have part 2 of the day since it was easier to add to the code for part 1
- my best solution imo is either day 7 part 2 (operator combinations) or day 13 (claw machine)
