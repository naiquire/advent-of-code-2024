# Advent of Code 2024
This is a collection of some of my favourite solutions that i made to some of the problems from AOC 2024
- some problems only have part 2 of the day since it was easier to add to the code for part 1
- you might be able to find the part 1 code somewhere but could take some effort
- best days imo are 7 13 15 and 19 (operators, claw machine, flowers, towels)
